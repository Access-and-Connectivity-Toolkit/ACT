# Welcome to ACT Broadband
__Access Connectivity Toolkit__

This was a great project to improve on the NTIA's Broadband Community Assessment Tool (BCAT)
We built a really open-source tool designed for broadband community action teams to use in documenting the need for broadband and the resources available to get it.  
## Current status: Shut Down
The Project and the app are now **shut down**, though they could be reactivated quickly if there were users.
It has a few outdated dependencies and we could no longer maintain the code, so we shut down the app in 2021.


## What it was
The system was built in Node.js using the [Keystone CMS](https://keystonejs.com/) libraries.  The beta testing app ran on a small cloud-based virtual machine based on Ubuntu 18.04. It relies on a separate instance of MongoDB, which can run on the same VM if you don't have too many users. It also runs fine on a Raspberry Pi 3.
Much of the work was done as a [project](https://democracylab.org/projects/21) at DemocracyLab hackathon events in 2018-2019.
Thanks to a tremendous amount of great innovation and development by a very creative team, the app was successful in beta testing with communities around the US, but did not find users ready to commit when ready for production.

## Want to try it?
Instructions for cloning and building are [here](https://github.com/Access-and-Connectivity-Toolkit/ACT/tree/master), in the master branch of the repo.
The documentation, inclusing wireframes, survey material and art are available in the [design](https://github.com/Access-and-Connectivity-Toolkit/ACT/tree/master/design) folder of the master branch.
If you have questions, please contact the project owners through the github repo.
