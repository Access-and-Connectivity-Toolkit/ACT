						p The Broadband Community Assessment Tool (BCAT) is an online planning tool designed to 
							| inspire and support local broadband planning efforts. It was developed by dedicated 
							| volunteers committed to universal broadband access and community engagement. The 
							| application was informed by earlier work by the National Telecommunication and Information 
							| Administration, the Washington State Office of the CIO, members of the University of 
							| Washington Masters of Science in Information Management, and with input from local 
							| broadband leaders, advocates and industry members.
