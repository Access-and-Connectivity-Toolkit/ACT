# Broadband Connectivity Assessment Tool (BCAT)

## National Telecommunications &amp; Information Administration
## Washington State Office of the CIO

### Background and Need

During November 2017, the National Telecommunications &amp; Information Administration and State
of Washington, completed a beta rest of the BroadbandUSA Connectivity Assessment Tool
(BCAT). BCAT is a community-based planning tool designed to inform and accelerate local
broadband efforts. The tool supports local leaders as they advance broadband infrastructure
deployment, improve digital inclusion, stimulate economic development, and strengthen
broadband policies.

The online tool invites community teams to explore up to 12 broadband planning modules; to
view data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Federal Communications Commission; to
collaborate and record local responses; and to access a customized Action Report. The resulting
report links local teams to resources that can help them move quickly to translate issues and
aspirations into concrete plans that attract broadband investment and strengthen community
connectivity.

### Proposed Hack-a-thon Project

Objective: Develop a working prototype of the front-end interface to collect user input utilizing current wireframes and design specifications.

Based on previously conducted user research project, NTIA has a set of specifications for an initial version of the re-designed Broadband Connectivity Assessment tool that they would like to implement (see files for final design and wireframes). Eventually, the tool gathers information from the users in the form of a questionnaire housed within each category/module of interest and aggregates the data per module and overall to create a customer “Action Report” for the user at the end. At this time, getting the framework and initial working model for the front-end data collection web app in working order is of value to NTIA and the State of Washington.
